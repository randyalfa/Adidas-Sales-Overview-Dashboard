# Adidas Sales Overview Dashboard
In this project, I analyzed a dummy adidas US sales dataset to simulate Adidas business performance. Using Microsoft Power BI, I built an interactive dashboard to visualize total sales, profit, units sold, price per unit, and sales distribution by month, region, state, product, and retailer. This dashboard helps monitor sales trends and supports data-driven business decisions.
